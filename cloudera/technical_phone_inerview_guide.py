Cloudera technical phone interview guide

Preparation

Prior you schedule phone interview, please make sure to carefully reference this list:
    1. Have a computer with an internet connection ready before your phone screen
    2. you will likely be asked coding questions -- be prepared to write code (we sue tools like codebunk to
    collaborate).
    3. Have some general understanding of who we are as a company (check out our website todo
    , and the cloudera engineering blog todo)
    and do some basic homework on cloudera and its product offerings. todo
    It's always beneficial to know about the company you are interviewing with.
    4. Review the core technical areas list below.
    5. Review the clouderan values list below.

Core technical areas

Keep in mind, some of these areas may not be assessed by the interviewer, but it is recommended that you understand
the following areas in general. Please make sure to brush up on the following 5 main areas:

    1. CS fundamentals:
        a. Algorithm complexity (Big-O, complexity analysis, etc)
        b. General purpose algorithms (sorting, tree/graph, search etc)
        c. Data Structures (concepts, implementation, manipulation). eg: Linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs.

    2. Coding:
        a. Object oriented language concepts (virtual functions, overriding, overloading)
        b. Be prepared to demonstrate your proficiency in at least one programming language in depth (whether it is
        java, c++, python, etc)
        c. To brush up on coding skills we recommend testing yourself on www.topcoder.com todo

    3. General systems knowledge:
        a. Some basic concepts of synchronization, multi-threading (semaphore, locks, mutex),todo
         inter-process communication (signal, pipe, socket) todo
        b. general os internals (processes, threads, system calls, performance bottlenecks)

    4. Thought process / analytical skill (debugging /troubleshooting/ approach):
        a. Feel free to think out loud
        b. Make sure to listen as interviewers often provide hints to point you in the right direction.
        c. Assess all the possible options you have when dealing with an issue.
        d. Dont' be afraid to go back and debug or fix mistakes you may catch later. A valuable trait that interviewers
        like to see in candidates, is the candidate's approach to a problem, not just teh final results (but rather how
        you got to your solution).

    5. Articulating your experience:
        a. You may be asked behavioral questions in addition to technical questions. It is always beneficial to have an
        example of a relevant or meaningful professional experience to discuss and why it was significant to you?
        b. Examples: a previous project that you had led, a particular milestone you had achieved at your workplace, or
        a feature/ tool you've built that may have been very impactful to your team or customers.
