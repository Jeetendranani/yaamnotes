16. Greedy Algorithms

Algorithms for optimization problems typically go through a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. For
many optimization problems, using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efficient
algorithms will do. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a
locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. This chapter explores
optimization problems for which greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions. Before reading chapter, you should read
abut dynamic programming in chapter 15, particularly section 15.3.
