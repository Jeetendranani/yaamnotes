Why system design interviews?

1. What are system design interviews?
    In system design interviews, candidates are required to show their ability to develop a high-level architecture of
    a large system. Designing software systems is a very broad topic and even a software engineer having years of
    experience at a top software company may not claim to be an expert on system design. During such interviews,
    candidates have 30 to 40 minutes to answer questions like, "How to design a cloud storage system like dropbox?" or
    "how to design a search engine" etc. In real life, companies spend not weeks but months and hire a big team of
    software engineers to build such systems. Given this, then how can a person answer such a question in 40 minutes?
    Moreover, there is no set pattern of such questions. Questions are flexible, unpredictable, usually open-ended, and
    have no standard or squarely correct answer.

    unlike coding interviews where problem solving ability of the candidates is evaluated, design interviews consist of
    complicated and fuzzy questions which aim at testing the candidate's ability to analyze a vague and complicated
    problem, their compatibility with building large systems and how do they present their resolution. Such interviews
    also look into a candidate's competence in guiding and moving the conversation forward.

    these days, companies are least bothered about your pedigree, where you studied or where you come from but surely
    concerned about what you can do on the job. For them, the most important thing is your thought process and your
    mindset to look into and handle problems. For these counts, candidates are generally scared of the design
    interviews. but despite all this, I believe there is no need of scaring off. you need to get into what the companies
    want to know about you during these 40 minutes, which is basically "your approach and strategy to handle a problem"
    and how organized, disciplined, systematic and professional you are at solving it. What is your capacity to analyze
    an issue and your level of professional mechanics to solve it step by step?

    In short, system design interview is, just understanding it from interviewer's perspective. During the whole
    process, it is your discussion with the interviewer that is of core important.
