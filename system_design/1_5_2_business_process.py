    system analysis: the purpose of the system analysis phase is to built a logical model fo the new system. the first
    step is requirements modeling, where the analyst investigates business processes and documents what the new system
    must do to satisfy users. requirements modeling continues the investigation that began during the systems planing
    phase. to understand the system, fact finding using techniques such as interviews, surveys, document review,
    observation, and sampling is performed. the fact finding results are used to build business models, data and process
    models, and object models.
    the deliverable for the systems analysis phase is the system requirements document. the system requirements document
    describes management and user requirement, costs and benefits, and outlines alternative development strategies.

    system design: the purpose of the system deign phase is to create a physical model that will satisfy all documented
    requirements for the system. At this stage, the user interface is designed and necessary outputs, inputs, and
    processes are identified. in addition internal and external controls are designed and designed, including computer
    based and manual features to guarantee that the system will be reliable, accurate, maintainable, and secure.
    during the systems design phase, the application architecture is also determined, which programmers will use to
    transform the logical design into program modules and code.

    the deliverable for this phase is the system design specification, which is presented to management and users for
    review and approval. Management and user involvement is critical to avoid any misunderstanding about what the new
    system will do, how it will do it, and what it will cost.

    system implementation: during the systems implementation phase, the new system is constructed. whether the
    developers use structured analysis or oo methods, the procedure is teh same programs are written, tested and
    documented, and the system is installed. if the system was purchased as a package, system analysts configure the
    software and perform any necessary modifications, the objective of systems implementation phase is to deliver a
    completely functioning and documented information system. at the conclusion of this phase, the system is ready to
    use. final preparations include converting data to the new system's file, training users, and performing the
    actual transition to the new system.
