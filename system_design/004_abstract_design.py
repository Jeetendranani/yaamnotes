Step 2: Abstract design

Once you've scoped the system you're about to design, you should continue by outlining a high-level abstract design. The
goal of this is to outline all the important components that your architecture will need.

you can tell the interviewer that you would like to do that and draw a simple diagram of your ideas. Sketch your main
components and the connections between them. If you do this, very quickly you will be able to get feedback if you are
moving in the right direction. Of course, you must be able to justify the high-level design that you just drew.

Don't get lured to drive deep into some particular aspect of the abstract design. Not yet, Rather, make sure you sketch
the important components and the connection between them. justify your ideas in front of hte interviewer and try to
address every constraint and use cases.

Usually, this sort of high-level design is combination of well-known techniques, which people have developed. You have
to make sure you are familiar with what's out there and feel comfortable using this knowledge. In this chapter we will
assume that you have enough experience to design such a high-level system. Our goal is to focus more on the next steps,
where we will talk mainly about scalability and about removing bottlenecks.

If you feel like a complete beginner in system design, perhaps it will be very useful fo you to first look at a book on
the topic or take advantage fo some of resources we've shared in the sections of this course.
