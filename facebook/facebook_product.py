Ads interfaces

We build the products that advertisers use to create and manage ads on Facebook. We define success by making the
business that use our tolls more effective, which creates value for both businesses and people who use Facebook. We
are responsible for the entire front-end stack, from the database layer and core APIs to the most advanced JavaScript
based interfaces in the company. We pride ourselves on bing early adopters of new technology, which helps us handle
the incredible scaling challenges presented by advertisers. Recent examples include building the first React & Flux
based applications and now the first native mobile interfaces built entirely atop React Native.

Ads Delivery

The ads delivery team's goal is to help match people with the ads that are most likely to be relevant useful to them.
More relevant ads not only are a better experience for people but also deliver better results for advertisers since
they are bing shown to people who are most likely to be interested. In terms of technology, this team is responsible for
the infrastructure, machine learning, and optimization systems that determine which ads to deliver. Other key
responsibility include the auction logic for pricing ads in a way tht creates the right incentives for advertisers and
our integrity systems for preventing bad ads from bing shown to people. This team also looks to solve the tough product
challenge of delivering ads in a way that is predictable and intuitive for all types of advertisers, including those
with varying levels of sophistication.

AdTech

The adTech team is working to take the sophisticated software stack Facebook has built for its own use over the past 5
years and making it available to the world. We are combining Facebook machine-learning and optimization know-how with
our understanding of real people to provide advertisers and publishers (app developers, website owners, video producers)
with the ability to have higher quality advertising facilities. In turn, this creates a win-win-win situation where
everyone -- people, advertisers and publishers - get more out of their advertising. We work across the full stack and
are looking to hire systems and product engineers who are passionate about scaling and making a real impact on the
world.
