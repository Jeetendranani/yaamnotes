watch cracking the facebook interview - the approach: https://vimeo.com/interviewprepsession/theapproach
watch the facebook coding  interview - problem work through: https://vimo.com/interviewprepsession/preblemwalkthrough

why would facebook prep you?
    - be your best
    - be more comfortable
    - be more prepared
    - avoid common mistakes
    - take out he mystery

what to expect?

    - Phone
        algorithm / coding

    - onsite
        two algorithms / coding
        design
        behavioral and algorithms / coding

    for each interview
        - 5 minutes prior experience
        - 45 minutes
            - question 1
            - question 2
        5 minutes questions for interviewer


design question

    - scope
        ask questions
        make appropriate assumptions
    - define key components
        can be somewhat naive
    - identify issues
        bottlenecks, tradeoffs
    - repair & redesign

problem solving skill


walk through the interview question

- step 1: listen carefully and ask question
- step 2: draw an example
- step 3: create a brute force algorithm

coding interview:

    algorithm technology:
        - sorting
        - dived and conquer
        - dynamic programming / memoization
        - recursion

    data structures
        - array
        - stack /queue
        - hashset / hashmap / dictionary / hashtable
        - tree / binary tree
        - heap
        - graph
        - bloom filter

architecture:
    - network (IPC, TCP/IP) todo:
    - concurrency (threads, deadlock, starvation, consistency, coherence) todo
    - abstraction (understanding how os, filesystem, and database works) todo
    - real world performance (relative performance ram, disk, your network, ssd) todo
    - availability and reliability (durability, understanding how things can fail) todo
    - data storage (ram vs durable storage, compression, byte sizes) todo
    - cap theorem todo
    - byte math todo

The goal is figure out:
    - the general purpose and goals of their system.
    - what key resources and costs are required (hardware? people? bandwidth? storage?)
    - the fundamental bottlenecks and growth hurdles of their system.

suggestions:
    - dig into the implementation and performance of an open source system, understand things like how the system sores
    data on disk and how it compacts data.
    - be familiar with how databases and operating system work
    - practice on a whiteboard
