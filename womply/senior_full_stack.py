    Two terms thrown around a lot in the web industry are front-end and back-end. It can be a little frustrating since
    the difference between the front-end and back-end isnt' always perfect clear. They'are terms often used to describe
    aspects of the web industry. The front-end is also referred to as the client-side and is sometimes considered "web
    design". The back-end of the web industry is often called the server-side. Often when someone says they're a "web
    developer" they're saying they work on the back-end of sites. While that explanation seems simple, the line between
    the two is often blurry. Here are some basic guidelines to help tell teh difference between the front-end and
    back-end or at least be able to begin to understand what someone does when they say they're a "front-end developer".

front-end
    The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including design and some language like html and css.
    most of the web courses created at digital tutors will be for the front-end and focused on design, but there are
    already a bunch of frot-end specific courses available at pluresight as well.

back-end
    The back-end, or the server-side, is basically how the site works, updates and changes. This refers to everything
    the user can't see in hte browser, like databases and servers. Usually people who work on the backend are called
    programmer or developers. Back end developers are mostly worried about thing like security, structure and content
    management. They usually know and can use languages like thml and css, but that's definitely not their focus.
    Backend developers, or at least backend development, is required to create a dynamic site, A dynamic site is a site
    is a site that's constantly changeing and updated in real-time. Most sites are dynmic sites, as oppsoed to static
    sites. Facebook, google Maps and this blog are all considered dynamic sites.

semantic html
    What is semantic html

    Semantic html or semantic markup is html that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For
    example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational,
    because people know what paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them.

    On the flip sides of this equation, tags like <b> and <i> are not semantic, because they define only how the text
    should look (bold and italic) and do not provide any additional meaning to the markup.

    examples of semantic html tags include the header tags <h1> through <h6>, <blockquote>, <code> and <em>. There are
    many more semantic HTML tags that can be used as you build a standards-compliant website.

responsive css
