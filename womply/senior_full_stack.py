semantic html
    What is semantic html

    Semantic html or semantic markup is html that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For
    example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational,
    because people know what paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them.

    On the flip sides of this equation, tags like <b> and <i> are not semantic, because they define only how the text
    should look (bold and italic) and do not provide any additional meaning to the markup.

    examples of semantic html tags include the header tags <h1> through <h6>, <blockquote>, <code> and <em>. There are
    many more semantic HTML tags that can be used as you build a standards-compliant website.
