Level order traversal - introduction

Level order traversal is to traverse the tree level by level

Breadth first search is an algorithm to traverse or search in dta structures like a tree or a graph. The algorithm
starts with a root node and visit the node itself first. Then traverse its neighbors, traverse its second level
neighbors, traverse its third level neighbors, so on and so forth.

When we do breadth first search in a tree, the order of the nodes we visited is in level order.

Typically, we use a queue to help use to do BFS, if you are not so familiar with the queue, you can find more
information about that in another card coming soon.
